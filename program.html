    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <iframe class="flex-item-left" style="border: 0;" scrolling="yes" src="index.html"></iframe>

        <textarea class="flex-item-right">text area!!!!!!!</textarea>
    </div>


    <button>Make RLE</button>
    <p> This is the RLE file which was produced!! When you hit "Make RLE" the text here is replaced with the RLE representation of your circuit...</p>
    <p>Ideally, I'll simplify this a bunch so the game of life sim only has run and control buttons, and then you just have a run (and produce RLE) button so that when you code your circuit up it simply appears in the GOL simulator. Also some sort of menu bar with an about or language reference section would be nice...</p>
